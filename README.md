# iPhone-Blocklist
A list of domains to allow/block that will not break the iPhone and minimise telemetry for general and educational use. 
This doesn't provide complete privacy in Apple use-cases but blocks minor telemetry missed by bigger lists.

#### What's it Blocking?

Refer to the [Denylist](./Denylist). This is used in conjuction with [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/) and the following:
- NextDNS Ads & Trackers Blocklist
- AdGuard DNS filter
- osid
- Disconnect (Tracking)
- NSABlocklist
- AdAway
- Disconnect (Ads)
- Goodbye Ads
- notracking
- WindowsSpyBlocker (Spy)
- Disconnect (Malvertising)
- antipopads
- UnchekyAds
- EasyPrivacy
- EasyList
- Steven Black
- AdGuard Mobile Ads filter
- Adguard Base filter
- Adguard Tracking Protection filter

While this blocks over <kbd>1,350,400 entires</kbd> (with duplicates in overlapping lists), there isn't much for Apple telemetry.
This hasn't broken my iPhone yet but if a domain breaks your use-case, just disable/add to your own [Allowlist](./Allowlist).

#### Community Support Needed!

There are many Apple domains that don't have an explanation or are withheld due to the walled garden. But you can help by updating the [currently known domains list](./Currently%20Known%20Domains).

#### Alternatives

I currently use this on an Apple iPad mini Wi-Fi (2012) and an iPhone 7 Plus (2016) - with hopes for the list to be impletemented on an iMac Pro (2017).

If you're looking for a free and very simple set-and-forget-hassle-free solution, I highly recommend [Lockdown Privacy](https://lockdownprivacy.com/) on the iOS and Mac Appstore as a simple tracker and ad blocker.

Hope this helps!
