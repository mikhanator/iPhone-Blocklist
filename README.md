# iPhone-Blocklist
A list of domains to allow/block that will not break the iPhone and minimise telemetry for general use. 

This isn't for completely privacy but to block minor telemetry missed by bigger lists for Apple use-case.

This is used in conjuction with NextDNS and the following:
- NextDNS Ads & Trackers Blocklist
- AdGuard DNS filter
- osid
- Disconnect (Tracking)
- NSABlocklist
- AdAway
- Disconnect (Ads)
- Goodbye Ads
- notracking
- WindowsSpyBlocker (Spy)
- Disconnect (Malvertising)
- antipopads
- UnchekyAds
- EasyPrivacy
- EasyList
- Steven Black
- AdGuard Mobile Ads filter
- Adguard Base filter
- Adguard Tracking Protection filter

While this blocks over 1,350,400 entires (with duplicates in overlapping lists), there isn't much for Apple telemetry.
While this hasn't broken my iPhone yet, if a domain breaks your use-case, just disable/add to your own Allowlist.

Hope this helps!
